Today, we need to look at some unconscious stories that we may have going around in the background.

Human beings think in stories. This is why in a class or lecture, you will not remember a lot of the information, but if they tell you a story, everyone can remember it.

Meaning, a set of events can take on a whole other meaning depending on who, what, or how they occurred.

You tell yourself a story in regards to this so that there is a narrative that you have told yourself running through your life.

Are you following me on this?

Ok, let me explain it in a very personal sense.

As we are growing up, our families refer to us in a certain way. We almost get a reputation or a brand to a certain extent by our families, in our school, and by our peers and friends as we are growing up.

Some of us have positive branding like, "The smart one," "the lucky one," even "the special one." But some of us have branding like, "the not so good looking one," "the dumb one," even "the fat one."
But these labels and brand stories stay with us from our childhood and even though we can overcome them, they can still play out a narrative in our life.

Think back, I bet you can hear some of the names or labels you were referred to? name some

--input here-- what names/labels did they give you?


What role did you take with your friends?

Were you the outsider, the life of the party, the class clown, or the introspective shy quiet one?

These brand roles we take on subconsciously and even when we outlive or overcome them surprisingly can still hold a narrative in our lives on one level or another. Were you the one that was always going to succeed?

Or perhaps the peacemaker of the family?

Take a moment to think back, what are some of the voices referring to you as?

Whether it be the cranky, cute, artistic, stupid, hyperactive, or something else. What role did you hold in your family?

What can you remember as the message given to you about who you were? What voice can you still hear as an undercurrent?

--image 2--

If you were to give the voice personality, would it be male or female?

--image 3--

What does it say to you? What is the underlying message?

--image 4--

How does this play out in your life and what does this feel like?

--image 5--

The tone of this feeling can build you up or tear you down. Rob you of your accomplishments or even stop you before you start.

We need to ensure your brand voice supports you and helps propel you into the world.

Your name is a brand; it has an identity and needs a clear message to carry you through the world.

I want to really explain how this works, so it gives you greater clarity on how your brand and having a clear idea of it can assist you in having a message and purpose.

Are we okay to explore this deeper so we can create a really clear, powerful personal brand?

Ok here we go

Your brand is really about getting clear on your purpose or otherwise known as your WHY.
Our why is what motivates us in the world.

The why is our brand essence.

We then have what we do (The what)

and the how we do it (with grace, with resentment, it is the tone with which we do things).

it looks like this

An example would look something like this for the Salvation Army or Red Cross.

Are you getting the basic gist and understanding how a brand works? Or do you need further or a better explanation?

coke is very famous branding that you will easily see how each part works

I think you will find it interesting once we start to apply it to our own personal branding.

If you indulge me for a moment, we can get much clearer on your purpose and how you can express that clearer.

Ok, you ready?

Your personal brand is not what you do...But "Why" you do it.

Your purpose in doing the things you do or want to do in the world.

Ok, we are going to get to the nuts and bolts of your purpose, your why.
